### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In JavaScript you can write your own functions which refer to a group of JavaScript statements that are executed as a single unit.
2. If you want to execute certain paths when one option is selected in a form and another path if a different option is selected in a form, you must use if/else statements in the JavaScript.
3. To fully clear the results from a form in Javascript the code must include .innerHTML.
